# BenchmarkingCppAlgorithms

Welcome to the Benchmarking Technical Reports and Source Codes! This repository contains a comprehensive report and source codes in C++20 for Benchmarking Performance of 3 Implementations of C++ Algorithms in STL, oneAPI (& SYCL) & CUDA
The hardware platforms are CPU, Intel GPU and NVidia GPU

## Table of Contents
- Benchmarking Performance of 3 Implementations of C++ Algorithms in STL, oneAPI (& SYCL) & CUDA
- Scalability Test of 3 Implementations of C++ Algorithms in STL, oneAPI (& SYCL) & CUDA
- Benchmarking Performance of C++ Algorithms with different data types: float, double, long, int, short, char
- Benchmarking Performance of Execution Policies: std::execution::seq, std::execution::par & std::execution::unseq


## Introduction
Full source code of Benchmarking software as well as technical report (results) are included to check running performance of different implementations of C++ Algorithms: std::sort()  oneapi::dpl::sort()  thrust::sort()


## Installation
Provided codes can be compiled and executed in command line using MSVC, nvcc and DPC++ (icpx) compilers. Installations of CUDA and oneAPI toolkit are described in the PDF file (technical report)

## Usage
It is described in the PDF file (the technical report)


## Examples
- Code to test Performance of std::sort() in STL
- Code to test Performance of oneapi::dpl::sort() in oneAPI 
- Code to test Performance of thrust::sort() in CUDA

## Documentation
The technical report is also included in the repository
